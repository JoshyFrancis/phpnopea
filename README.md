## About Phpnopea
Phpnopea is an alternative to laravel and excels in performance. It is based and built on same laravel principles. In our company, I was requested to speed up laravel and I came up with this.

#### Based on Laravel version 5.4.23

## Features
* Classes are minimal and optimized but all the necessary functions incorporated.
* Blade template have been optimized to skip empty lines, comments(php,js,css) etc.(Only multiline comments allowed for single line php code eg:<?php /*echo $share_otf; */ ?>)
  It helps dramatic reduction in file size as well as the bandwidth usage.
* Only 30 classes are required for the whole framework and to run a typical laravel project.
* Simplified error logging. Tracking errors is easier than ever.
